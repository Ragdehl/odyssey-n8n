# Functional Roadmap

This is Odyssey's canonical source for **functional implementation status, intended order, and the next adoption gate**. Detailed contracts and historical evidence live in linked phase documents, ADRs, and benchmarks rather than being copied here.

Status: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** · ➡️ **NEXT** · ⬜ **PLANNED** · 💡 **LATER / CONDITIONAL**

## Completed foundation

| Phase | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 9 | Deterministic exact entity resolution by canonical name/alias. |
| 10 | Local semantic entity candidate retrieval; similarity is evidence only. |
| 11 | Contextual/hybrid existing-entity resolution with deterministic Core validation. |
| 12 | Explicit deterministic entity persistence primitives. |
| 13 | General knowledge context retrieval (`get_context`) over rebuildable local indexes. |
| 14 | Validated top-level `RequestPlan` interpretation. |
| 15–15.3 | Semantic write planning, schema-aware selection/mutations, explicit links/tags, generic delegation preservation. |
| 16–16.7C | Safe create/update targeting, bounded UPDATE writing, deterministic CREATE, reference binding, bulk UPDATE, soft DELETE, and type migration. |
| 17A–17C | Executable Core application flow, durable pending work, and request-correlated local Git history. |
| 17D | Append-first atomic facts with request-derived fact locators and targeted correction/removal. |
| 17E | Pre-E2E schema/retrieval validation; unevidenced Combined Top-500 adoption withdrawn after identity-aware correction. |
| 18 | First real n8n -> runtime -> Core WRITE/READ end-to-end path. |
| 19 | Retry/failure hardening plus bounded timing/provider-usage evidence. |

Canonical/historical detail remains in the phase documents under this directory and in [Architecture Decisions](../decisions/README.md). The [Architecture Overview](overview.md) describes the current composed system without replaying this history.

## Current phase — Phase 21: production/development isolation

Goal: keep production personal knowledge and product flow isolated from ordinary development and testing.

See [Phase 21 — production/development isolation](phase-21-development-isolation.md) and the historical [Phase 20 — Odyssey Online MVP](phase-20-odyssey-online-mvp.md).

### 20.1B — answerer adoption gate

Complete. Frozen live evidence selected the inexpensive grounded answerer without weakening the bounded evidence contract. See [Phase 20.1 grounded-answerer benchmark](phase-20-1-grounded-answerer-benchmark.md).

### 20.2B — real browser integration

Complete. The checked-in `odyssey_web/` surface is served through the private n8n-facing product boundary. Raspberry-backed integration evidence covers the narrow request/response routes, and the physical Chrome/Android checkpoint covers the mobile UI, bounded delivery failure, restored controls, and explicit same-`request_id` Retry behavior.

### 20.2C — planner incident hardening

Complete. The production planner has explicit clarification, a bounded output envelope, zero automatic retries, and bounded post-parse validation diagnostics. See [Planner incident hardening](planner-incident-hardening.md).

### 20.2D–20.2F — Luna-first planner adoption

Complete. Luna/low inherited the strongest established RequestPlan semantics, passed the focused prompt-parity/atomicity gates, and is now the production first pass. Safe PLAN/CLARIFY returns directly; structured fail-closed may invoke one bounded Sol/low fallback. Separate provider-call evidence preserves the real Luna/Sol usage split. See [Phase 20.2F — Luna-first production planning](phase-20-2f-luna-first-production.md).

### 20.2G — contextual reasoner Luna replacement

Complete. The full frozen 90-case Luna/medium benchmark produced 88/90 frozen-label accuracy, 35/35 correct `RESOLVED` decisions, zero clear false `RESOLVED`, and zero invalid outputs. Production now uses Luna/medium with the same canonical ten-example calibration prefix. See [Phase 20.2G — contextual reasoner Luna replacement gate](phase-20-2g-contextual-luna-gate.md).

### 20.3 — protected deployment

Complete and merged in PR #103. The protected Cloudflare boundary, disposable mobile E2E, production-vault Git bootstrap/index rebuild, and bounded real-runtime activation were all verified before merge.

```

20.3B uses the dedicated `odyssey.ragdehl.com` Access application with the approved user identity, tunnel-side Access JWT validation, and a separate deny-by-default Access application covering only the five Odyssey paths on `n8n.ragdehl.com`; unrelated n8n root/admin behavior remains unchanged. The Cloudflare/certificate/Docker-DNS recovery details belong to the Phase 20.3 deployment document rather than this roadmap.

20.3C used an isolated disposable vault/runtime/pending root before any real-vault product test. The protected mobile E2E has successful WRITE, READ, and explicit clarification evidence, plus request-correlated Markdown/Git evidence. During clarification testing, a deployment-drift bug was found: the active n8n Odyssey product workflow had fallen behind the checked-in `workflows/odyssey-online.ts` contract. The existing active workflow was reconciled and republished without creating a second active endpoint, and the final protected browser clarification passed. At the 20.3C close the disposable runtime and test state were stopped/removed and port `8765` was free; 20.3D subsequently activated the separate real production runtime after the authorized vault bootstrap.

20.3D initialized `/data/odyssey/vault` as the exact production Git repository root with empty baseline commit `465773757427597b1f6036e94e670c8dd360d882`, reset only the guarded rebuildable `context.sqlite3` and `semantic.sqlite3` indexes, rebuilt them from the empty canonical vault, and started the private production runtime. Post-start evidence showed HTTP 200 on `172.18.0.1:8765/healthz`, with no listener on `127.0.0.1:8765`. No synthetic personal WRITE was used for activation.

The first mobile E2E also exposed a product requirement: the visible chat currently does not carry conversation context into the planner, so a follow-up such as `¿Dónde vive?` safely abstains even after discussing one person. That future requirement is now owned by [Future Odyssey help and conversation context](future-help-and-conversation-context.md).

## Phase 21 status — production and development isolation

Phase 20.3 is merged and the production path is available for real use. Phase 21A and 21B are complete; the next gate is 21C, establishing persistent development/staging operations and evaluating a separate development n8n instance so disposable tests cannot affect the production runtime or personal knowledge.

The first real personal production cycle is now complete. On 2026-09-11 the mobile UI wrote `Me llamo Edgar, soy data engineer y trabajo en Alten para Airbus`, producing one canonical `person` note for Edgar with two atomic facts and a request-correlated Git commit/index refresh; the subsequent mobile READ `¿Dónde trabaja Edgar?` returned `Edgar trabaja en Alten para Airbus.` No synthetic benchmark request was used for this milestone.

```text
first real personal use                               ✅ complete
        |
        v
production / development isolation                    ✅ 21A–21B complete
        |

        |
        v
conversation persistence / continuity
        |
        v
real-usage-driven UI / capability work
```

Phase 21A and 21B are complete. The production/development split should precede substantial new feature development so future disposable tests cannot affect real personal knowledge. See the [Phase 21 evidence](phase-21-development-isolation.md).

The self-identity step should stay small: bind the stable current/authenticated user identity to an ordinary canonical `person` note by stable note ID so first-person requests and future applications can reuse the same knowledge. The person note stays in the normal vault/search/statistics surface; only the account/actor binding is separate identity state. See [Future user self-identity binding](future-user-self-identity.md).

## Committed post-MVP directions

These are real product directions; exact implementation should remain incremental.

### Production and development isolation

Once real use depends on Odyssey, maintain a stable production deployment and a separate development/staging deployment so feature work and disposable tests cannot affect users or personal knowledge. `main` remains the production-ready source by default; feature branches feed development/staging before promotion. A permanent `develop` branch is optional and should be introduced only if repeated parallel integration work justifies it. See [Development Pipeline](development-pipeline.md#production-and-development-isolation).

### Natural conversation and history

Conversation continuity is now a concrete post-MVP requirement, not only a speculative idea. The intended architecture is **context on demand**, not a hard-coded “always send the last N messages” window.

```text
current request
      |
      v
same Luna-first planner
      |
      +--> self-contained -> execute normally
      |
      `--> context needed
               |
               v
       retrieve relevant conversation evidence
               |
               v
       same planner, bounded second pass
```

Conversation/history must remain a source/authority distinction, not an ordinary canonical note type. Visible conversation records should be durable Markdown-like non-knowledge state; historical retrieval must remain logically isolated from current personal-knowledge retrieval. Later coarse-to-fine navigation may use derived conversation/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly summaries that point back to raw conversations. See [Future Odyssey help and conversation context](future-help-and-conversation-context.md).

### Composable applications and capabilities

Applications should reuse shared Odyssey knowledge and lower-level capabilities rather than creating isolated stores or duplicate semantics. A useful target is composition such as:

```text
Reminders <- Tasks <- Projects
```

Planner/model extensibility must stay configuration-driven where semantics are already supported. The current planner derives note-type/property capabilities from `config/note-schema.json`; downstream model boundaries are generic with respect to concrete note types. The remaining application gap is executable manifest/registry routing for `DelegateAction`, not hard-coded app selection in the base planner. See [Architecture Overview](overview.md#configuration-driven-model-boundaries), [Future Extension Points](future-extension-points.md), and [Odyssey Platform Direction](odyssey-platform-direction.md).

### Multi-user shared knowledge

Support private and selectively shared knowledge only after authentication, authorization-before-retrieval, synchronization, conflict, and storage boundaries are explicit. A shared household list is an early concrete validation scenario. Each authenticated actor should be able to bind to its own ordinary canonical `person` note without creating a special `user` knowledge type or per-application profile copy.

See [Multi-user Collaboration Direction](multi-user-collaboration-direction.md) and [Future user self-identity binding](future-user-self-identity.md).

## Later / conditional directions

The detailed index is [Future Extension Points](future-extension-points.md). Important preserved directions include:

- 💡 **Retrieval refinement from real misses:** first test query-decomposed multi-fact/entity-coverage retrieval; only then add candidate reduction or compact evidence if measured cost/volume justifies it. See [Future retrieval refinements](future-query-decomposed-retrieval.md).
- 💡 **Pending-reference evolution / schema coaching:** safely relink exact attributable occurrences and use repeated unresolved patterns only as advisory evidence for future schema proposals. See [Future pending-reference evolution](future-pending-reference-evolution.md).
- 💡 **Hierarchical conversation summaries:** conversation/day/week/month/year derived summaries may later narrow historical search before drilling down to raw supporting turns; they remain rebuildable navigation aids, never authority. See [Future Odyssey help and conversation context](future-help-and-conversation-context.md).
- 💡 **Usage/cost observability:** project already-collected safe operational/provider evidence into simple and advanced product views without creating a second tracing authority. This now explicitly includes integration/deployment provenance and a `MATCH | DRIFT | UNKNOWN` view of checked-in workflow source versus the active deployed workflow. See [Future product usage observability](future-product-usage-observability.md).
- 💡 **Capture-context provenance:** optional location/context belongs to fact/request provenance, not entity properties. See [Future capture-context provenance](future-capture-context-provenance.md).
- 💡 **Platform/local-first portability:** keep Core/data contracts usable by self-hosted, future local/mobile, app, and agent clients without making a central Odyssey server semantically mandatory. See [Odyssey Platform Direction](odyssey-platform-direction.md).
- 💡 **Direct Markdown/Obsidian edit ingestion:** eventually recognize authorized external edits, avoid self-trigger loops, validate only required normalization, refresh derived state, and audit accepted changes.
- 💡 **Structured analytics:** deterministic counts/sums/grouping over rebuildable structured/index data; do not load the whole vault into an LLM for arithmetic.
- 🔄 **Cost-aware model routing:** Luna-first production planning and Luna/medium contextual reasoning are active; retain bounded Sol fallback only where the validated production contract requires it and continue optimizing from measured telemetry rather than assumption.
- 💡 **Proactive resurfacing:** non-disruptive reminders/context suggestions only after direct usage demonstrates value.
- 💡 **Performance/index optimization:** optimize from measurements, not anticipated scale.

## Roadmap rule

This file records **current status and intended sequencing**, not every implementation detail. When a phase completes, update the status here and leave its detailed contract/evidence in the phase document, ADR, tests, and benchmark records. Do not duplicate those historical narratives back into the roadmap.
